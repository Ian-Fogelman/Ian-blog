A super valueable skill that is worth knowing and practicing on a weekly basis is Language Integrated Query or LinQ statements. 
Linq statements can be defined in c# and extract data from various object types. The flexibility of being able to apply 
a uniform language to extract data to different object types is what makes linq so valuable.

We have two arrays of strings, the first has strings the word version of 1 - 10, the second has a-z as characters.

{% highlight csharp %}
String[] QueryString = {"One","Two","Three","Four","Five","Six","Seven","Eight","Nine","Ten"};

String[] IndexArray = {"A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"};


{% endhighlight %}
