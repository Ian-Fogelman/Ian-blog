The use case for DQS is simple, a quick way to audit and correct data through an abstraction layer. This abstraction layer can be
managed by someone other than a DBA or developer and help improve your database's data quality and over all employee productivity.

<br>
<br>

First step is to install the DQS client, you can search for data quality server installer on your machine running your SQL instance.

<br>
<br>

Lets take a simple set of data as follows :

<br>
<br>

<div class="container-fluid">
    <table class="datatable table table-hover table-bordered">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Fname</th>
          <th>Lname</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tfoot>
      </tfoot>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Ian</td>
          <td>Fogelman</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Bill</td>
          <td>Gates</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>Jim</td>
          <td>Brown</td>
        </tr>
		        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>D</td>
          <td>Smith</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>J</td>
          <td>Green</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

Suppose that we want to enforce a business rule that each first name must be at least 3 characters.
We will solve this using a DQS approach.
