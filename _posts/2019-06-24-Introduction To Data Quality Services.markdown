The use case for DQS is simple, a quick way to audit and correct data through an abstraction layer. This abstraction layer can be
managed by someone other than a DBA or developer and help improve your database's data quality and over all employee productivity.

First step is to install the DQS client, you can search for data quality server installer on your machine running your SQL instance.

Lets take a simple set of data as follows :

<div class="container-fluid">
    <table class="datatable table table-hover table-bordered">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Fname</th>
          <th>Lname</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tfoot>
      </tfoot>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Ian</td>
          <td>Fogelman</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Bill</td>
          <td>Gates</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>Jim</td>
          <td>Brown</td>
        </tr>
		        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>D</td>
          <td>Smith</td>
        </tr>
		<tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>J</td>
