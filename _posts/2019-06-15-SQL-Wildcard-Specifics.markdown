Today I will touch on the wild card functionality in SQL. 
Many times you will be searching for records in a database table by some type of name.
Instead of looking specifically for an exact match on a name you can specify a wildcard search in your where statement by using a like clause.

Lets take the following dataset into consideration:

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <table class="datatable table table-hover table-bordered">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Address</th>
          <th>Class</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tfoot>
      </tfoot>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Jane</td>
          <td>123 Beech street</td>
          <td>Math</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>John</td>
          <td>1234 Smith street</td>
          <td>Math</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>Jasmin</td>
          <td>4432 Etcher Rd</td>
          <td>Science</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
